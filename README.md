# Crossmint Challenge
## Quick start
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Run the script with `npm start`

## Side notes
* The script gets the `candidateId` from a `.env` file that should not be published in the repository, but I published it anyway to allow testing if needed.
* Both phases can be solved by running the script with `npm start`, as it just fetches the goal using the provided endpoint and recreates it without considering the phase.
